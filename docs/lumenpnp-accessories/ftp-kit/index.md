# Getting Started Kit Assembly

## Intro

The purpose of this work instruction is to explain the assembly process for the LumenPnP Getting Started Kit

## Preparing Universal PCB Fixture System

1. Obtain materials shown here

## Preparing Component Bag

1. Obtain the resistors and a `3x4 bag`

	![](img/IMG_2592.webp)

1. Obtain 450 resistors by cutting the tape to 1.8m lengths

	![](img/IMG_2257.webp)

1. Coil the component tape and pack it into the `3x4 bag`

	![](img/IMG_2258.webp)

1. Seal `3x4 bag`
