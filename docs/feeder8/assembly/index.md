# Final Assembly

1. Press in 8x M3 nuts into a frame using the arbor press.

2. Plug the peel motor into the 2-pin connector on the PCB as shown:

3. Slide the peel motor into the slot in the frame print, and tuck as much of the cable into the space behind the motor as possible.

4. Press the PCB flat to the print, and make sure the cable is not caught between them. It should lay flush.

5. Insert 3x M3x15mm Flathead screws into the holes in the PCB shown below. Drive them all the way in. Make sure they engage with the M3 nuts inserted into the back of the print.

6. Grab a spring and a `lock-arm`, and hold the spring in the lock arm as shown. Match the other end of the spring up with the circular cutoout in the `frame` print, and drop the `lock-arm` into the `frame`.

7. Insert an M3x15mm Flathead screw from the back side and drive it in. The screw will tap into the plastic of the `lock-arm`. Don't overtighten; make sure the arm can still swivel easily.

8. Grab a `right-angle-n20` and push it into the cavity in the `frame` shown below.

9. Make sure the back of the motor is perfectly flush with the back of the print.

10. Drop in a `drive-motor-bracket` and make sure the cutout matches up with the `frame` cutout for the `indexing-wheel`.

11. Insert 2x M3x12mm Flathead screws and tighten them down gently. *DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN*. Overtightening can lead to the motor skewing in the `frame`.

12. Check that the motor is still flush, and hasn't skewed because of tightening. If so, loosen the screws and adjust the motor.

13. Place the Indexing Wheel Shim in the `indexing-wheel` cavity as shown, with the drive motor spindle sticking through it.

14. Drop the `indexing-wheel` with a mounted `shaft-collar` onto the spindle.

15. With one hand, press down hard on the indexing wheel, and with the other tighten the shaft collar.

16. Remove the Indexing Wheel Shim.

17. Insert the drive motor cable into the six-pin connector on the PCB.

18. Pack the remaining cable into the void in the `frame` as shown.

19. Place a `drive-motor-cover` over the `indexing-wheel` and ensure it lays flat and none of the cabling is keeping it from seating properly.

20. Insert 2x M3x15mm Flathead screws in the locations shown below, and drive them in. Ensure they engage with the M3 nuts on the back.
