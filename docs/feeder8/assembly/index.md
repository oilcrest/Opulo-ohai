# Final Assembly

## Install the `peel-motor-asm` and `feeder-motherboard`

1. Plug the `peel-motor-asm` into the 2-pin connector on the PCB

2. Slide the `peel-motor-asm` into its corresponding cavity in `feeder-frame-8mm`
	* Tuck the excess cable into the empty region behind the `peel-motor-asm`

3. Press the PCB flat into `feeder-frame-8mm`
	* Make sure the cable is not caught between them - it should lay flush

4. Insert 3x `M3x15mm` flathead screws into the holes in the PCB as shown below
	* Make sure they fully engage with the `M3-hex-nut` pieces in the backside of `feeder-frame-8mm`

	!!! inspect "QC Check - Test if the buttons on `feeder-frame-8mm` can easily actuate the switches on the PCB before proceeding"

## Install the `release-lever`

5. Install the spring
	* Grab a spring and a `release-lever`, and hold the spring in the `release-lever` as shown 
	* Match the other end of the spring up with the circular cutout in the `feeder-frame-8mm` print
	* Finally, drop the `release-lever` into the `feeder-frame-8mm`

6. Insert an `M3x15mm` flathead screw from the backside and drive it in 
	* The screw will tap into the plastic of the `release-lever` 
	* Don't over-tighten; make sure the arm can still swivel easily

## Install the `drive-motor`

7. Push a `drive-motor` into the cavity in `feeder-frame-8mm` as shown below

   ![](img/PXL_20230125_210041399.jpg)

8. Make sure the back of the `drive-motor` is perfectly flush with the backside of `feeder-frame-8mm`
   
  	![](img/PXL_20230125_210049496.jpg)

9. Install a `drive-motor-bracket` while making sure the cutout matches up with the `feeder-frame-8mm` cutout for `drive-wheel-asm`
   
   	![](img/PXL_20230125_210103973.jpg)

10. Insert 2x `M3x12mm` flathead screws and tighten them down gently 
	!!! warning "*DO NOT OVER-IGHTEN*. Over-tightening can lead to the motor skewing in the `feeder-frame-8mm`."
   
   	![](img/PXL_20230125_210136695.jpg)

11. Check that the `drive-motor` is still flush and hasn't skewed because of tightening
	* If it appears crooked or not flush, loosen the screws and readjust the `drive-motor`
   
   	![](img/PXL_20230125_210049496.jpg)

## Install the `drive-wheel-asm`

12. Place the `Drive Wheel Shim` in the `drive-wheel-asm` cavity as shown, with the `drive-motor` shaft sticking through it
   
   	![](img/PXL_20230125_210301849.jpg)

13. Drop the `drive-wheel-asm` onto the `drive-motor` shaft
   
	![](img/PXL_20230125_210309516.jpg)

14. With one hand, press down hard on the `drive-wheel-asm`, and with the other tighten the set-screw on the `shaft-collar-asm`

15. Remove the `Drive Wheel Shim`

## Plug `drive-motor` into `feeder-motherboard`

16. Insert the `drive-motor` cable into the six-pin connector on the PCB
   
    ![](img/PXL_20230125_210435885.jpg)

17. Lay the cable in the channel that leads to the motherboard, as shown below
   
    ![](img/PXL_20230125_210523730.jpg)
    
    !!! note
    	This cable has gotten much shorter for mass-production feeders, so there will be no need to create a bundle of wires like this moving forward. 
    	
## Install `drive-motor-cover`

18. Place a `drive-motor-cover` over the `drive-wheel-asm`
	* The `drive-motor-cover` should lay flat with none of the cables preventing it from being flush against `feeder-frame-8mm` 
   
    ![](img/PXL_20230125_210540301.MP.jpg)

19. Insert 3x `M3x15mm` flathead screws in the locations shown below
	* Ensure the screws fully engage with the `M3-hex-nut` pieces on the backside of `feeder-frame-8mm`
    
     `TO DO: REPLACE THIS IMAGE WITH ONE THAT SHOWS 3 screws instead of 2`
