#Packout
This section will guide the reader on how to properly package 5x `feeder-8mm` units into their respective packaging tray.

* Fold a flat-packed `Corrugated Quad-Fold Feeder Insert` to prepare it for use
* Place 5x `feeder-8mm` into a `Corrugated Quad-Fold Feeder Insert` tray

	!!!note "Note on light-diffusor consistency"
		* Early feeder units were produced with two different styles of `light-diffuser` PCBs - regular (bare FR4 color w/black Opulo logo)and inverted (black soldermask with masked-out Opulo logo)
		* It is important to avoid mixing the two types within a single `Corrugated Quad-Fold Feeder Insert` tray
		* Please indicate that a `Corrugated Quad-Fold Feeder Insert` tray contains feeders w/the black `light-diffuser` by writing a `B` in the corner of the tray with a permanent marker.
	
	
* Insert a spool-arm above each of the  5x `feeder-8mm`, oriented to match the image shown below

*  Place 5x `thimble` into a `1x1-plastic-bag` before adding a little bit of double-sided tape to the backside of the bagged 3D prints

* Stick the `bagged-thimble-set` to the feeder the that's sitting in the visibly-deepest cavity in the tray
	* This is done to give the thimbles as much space as possible
	* Stick the bag to the PCB, but avoid adhering it to the `feeder-rev-label`
