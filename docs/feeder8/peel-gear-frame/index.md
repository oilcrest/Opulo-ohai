# Peel Gear Box
This section will guide the reader through the process of installing 2x `peel-gear` prints into `peel-gear-frame` to create `peel-gear-box` in preparation for its use in final assembly.

## Install 2x `peel-gear` into `peel-gear-frame`
* Pop 2x `peel-gear` into the `peel-gear-frame`, aligning the bumps in the frame to the divots in the gears

* Use a screwdriver and a `2mm hex` bit to tighten  2x `M3x14` flathead screws into `peel-gear-frame`
	* Tighten screws as much as possible without feeling resistance when turning the gears

* After the screws have been torqued, manually rotate the gears to check the friction
	* The tightened screws should not have added much (or any) resistance when spinning a `peel-gear` by hand
	* Loosen the screws a little bit if you observe high friction in the `peel-gear-box`

`TO DO: Add a QC Check that measures the torque required to spin an assembled peel-gear-box to ensure it's within a specified range`
