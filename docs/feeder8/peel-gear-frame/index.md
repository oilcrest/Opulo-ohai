## Materials Needed 

* `peel-gear-frame`
* 2x `peel-gear` per frame
* 2.0mm screwdriver
* 2x `M3x14mm-flat-head` per frame


## Install 2x `peel-gear` into `peel-gear-frame`
* Pop 2x `peel-gear` into the `peel-gear-frame`, aligning the bumps in the frame to the divots in the gears

 <!-- Use a screwdriver and a `2mm hex` bit to tighten  2x `M3x14` flathead screws into `peel-gear-frame` -->
 <!-- Tighten screws as much as possible without feeling resistance when turning the gears -->

## Screwing in `M3x14mm-flat-head` screws

* Use a 2.0mm screwdriver or the torque driver at desk to place and screw 2x `M3x14mm-flat-head` in `peel-gear-frame`. 
!!! Hold it Partner "When using the torque driver, make sure that it is set to 2."

* Loosen the screws a little bit if you observe high friction in the `peel-gear-box`
