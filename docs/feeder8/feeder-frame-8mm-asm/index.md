# 8mm/12mm Feeder Frame Assembly
This section will guide the reader through the process of installing various hardware components into `feeder-frame-8mm` or `feeder-frame-12mm` in preparation for its use in final assembly.

## Materials Needed

* `feeder-frame-8mm` or `feeder-frame-12mm`
* `LOCTITE 435`
* `8mm-fiducial-board` or `12mm-fiducial-board`
* `light-diffuser-pcb`
* `arbor-press-jig`
* `heat gun` potentially 
* `needle nose pliers`

## Prepare `feeder-frame-8mm`/`feeder-frame-12mm` 
* Inspect the print for defects.
	* Use a heat gun to remove any stringing.
	* Check the first layer to ensure it is free of defects and printed on the textured print bed as shown.

!!! Note "Hold it Partner" 
	
	* Make sure to double check you are working with the frame you intended to work with. You can always check the numbers on the frame to indicate if you are working with 8mm or 12mm frames.

<!-- need new pic above of updated frame -->
<!-- Make sure to note that the reader should double check if they have an 8 or 12. Use compare contrast pics -->

* Inspect for loose plastic in the overhanging region of the pick-window on the frame.
	* Remove any loose plastic with a knife as needed.

* Remove the support from frame with fingers or needle nose pilars.

## Install Light Diffuser
* Use an `arbor-press-jig` to install `light-diffuser-pcb (PCB-0013-01)` into intended feeder frame. 
	* The Opulo logo on `light-diffuser-pcb` should be in the correct orientation when the feeder is held in front of you.

* The installed `light-diffuser-pcb` should be flush to the top-face of `feeder-frame-8mm` when installed correctly

## Buttons 

* Firmly press the up and down buttons so that they can move freely

<!-- pic of buttons cause it isn't always easy for some of us *me* to find -->

!!! note "Hold it Partner"

		* These buttons are print-in-place flexures, which means they need to be broken away from the layer of plastic between the buttons and frame. 
			* Exercise care here, as pressing these buttons too far inward or outward can break them
		* The motherboard that is installed later will prevent the damage from the buttons moving too far inwards.

## Install 8mm Fiducial Board/ 12mm Fiducial Board

!!! Note "Hold it Partner" 
	
	It is important to be aware that the fiducial for the 8mm & 12mm frames are slightly different.
	
	* Be aware what frames you are working with
	* Be aware what fiducials you are gluing

<!-- pics of comparing fiducials here -->

* Add a small amount of `LOCTITE 435` in the front pocket of the feeder frame you are working with

* Manually install `8mm-fiducial-board` or `12mm-fiducial-board` into the front pocket of feeder frame
	*  The fiducial markers should remain visible when installed

* Orient frame upright for 30 minutes to allow `LOCTITE 435` time to cure
