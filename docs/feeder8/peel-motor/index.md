# Peel Motor Assembly

This section will guide the reader on how to properly glue the `worm-gear` onto the shaft of a `peel-motor` to create `peel-motor-asm`.

## Setup

## Assembly Process
* Add `LOCTITE 435` to `worm-gear`
		![](img/img2.JPG)
	* Dispense a few drops of `LOCTITE 435` into the center hole of `worm-gear`
	* Use enough adhesive for the glue to fully cover the top of the hole		![](img/img4.JPG)
	* Lightly tap `worm-gear` (glued hole side up) against the workbench a few times to break the surface tension of the glue and get it running downward
* **Leading with the glued side**, manually install the `worm-gear` onto the first few millimeters of the shaft on `peel-motor`

* Place the WIP `peel-motor-asm` into the `arbor-press-jig`

* Pull the lever of the `arbor-press-jig` downward to fully install the `worm-gear` onto the shaft of `peel-motor`

	!!! warning
		Only pull the lever enough to fully install the worm-gear, as excess force my damage the `arbor-press-jig` or `peel-motor-asm`!

* Release the `arbor-press-jig` lever to make the depth-stop actuate backwards

*  Remove the completed `peel-motor-asm` from the `arbor-press-jig`

* Manually rotate the installed `peel-gear` to check if any glue fell into the motor's gearbox

!!!failure "If you cannot rotate the installed `peel-gear` by hand, scrap the subassembly and record the material waste"
	
!!!success "Move the completed `peel-motor-asm` to the corresponding storage bin at the feeder assembly workstation"
