# Peel Motor Assembly

This section will guide the reader on how to properly glue the worm-gear (FDM-0058-00) onto the shaft of a peel-motor (MTR-0003-00) to create peel-motor-asm (ASM-0059-00).

* Add LOCTITE 435 Instant Adhesive to worm-gear

	* Dispense a few drops of LOCTITE 435 Instant Adhesive into the center hole of the worm-gear
	* Use enough adhesive for the glue to fully cover the top of the hole		![](img/img4.JPG)
	* Lightly tap the worm-gear (with glued hole side up) against the workbench a few times to break the surface tension of the glue and get it sliding downward
* **Leading with the glued side**, manually install the worm-gear onto the first few milimeters of the peel-motor shaft
