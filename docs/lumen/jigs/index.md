## Print & Usage Guidelines

1. **Material**

   * All jigs and fixtures are designed to use PLA, unless otherwise noted, for rigidity.

2. **Printer Settings**

   * **Layer height:** 0.2 mm (or finer for tolerance-critical parts)
   * **Infill:** 20–30% (increase to 50%+ for load-bearing jigs)
   * **Walls:** 3 perimeters for strength
   * **Supports:** As needed—check overhangs in your slicer preview
   * **Bed adhesion:** Use brim or raft for tall, narrow pieces

3. **Post-Processing**

   * Light sanding on mating faces for to tune fits as required
   * Drill or ream holes to exact dimensions as required
