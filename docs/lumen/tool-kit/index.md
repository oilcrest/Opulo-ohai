#Preparing LumenPnP Tool Kit


## Prepare `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit` (ASM-0048-03)
We purchase the `lumen-v3-hardware-kit` as a premade assembly but it's contents can become out of date with machine updates. It is important to ensure that customers always have a revision of this bag that matches the revision required by a given LumenPnP revision's BOM. 

Currently, we have repurchased several hundred pieces of `ASM-0048-02` which must be reworked to match the BOM listed in `ASM-0048-03`. You can confirm that a `lumen-v3-hardware-kit` **requires rework** into `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit` if it weights `95.8g +/- 0.5g`.

* Pre-purchased  pieces of `ASM-0048-02` in inventory must have the following components added into the bag to convert them in a `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit` before they're to be used in further assembly processes:

	* +7 pcs `M5x16-bolt`
	* +2 pcs `M5x10-bolt`
	* +2 pcs `silicone-grease-packet`
	* +4pcs `M5 t-nut`
	* +4PCS `M5x8-bolt`

### QC Check
* After reworking inventory to match the latest requirements of a `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit`, proceed with a weight check.
	* Confirm each bag weighs between `139.70g` - `140.50g`
	* If a bag weighs less than this, recount the pieces and rework as needed before proceeding
	* After a bag passes weight check, add a `QC Pass` sticker to the outside of the bag
		
	!!!note "Stockpiling `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit` pieces"
		If more pieces of `lumen-v3-hardware-kit` are reworked than what's needed for a given production batch, place the excess in a <span style="color:green"> green QC-Pass bin</span> labeled `lumen-v3.1-hardware-kit (ASM-0048-04)`
