## Intro
The purpose of this work instruction is to explain the assembly process for the LumenPnP v3.1.0 Left-Side Y-Gantry (`y-gantry-left`).

## Create Y-Gantry Subassembly
- Remove any stringing from the print with a heat gun
- Insert 6x `m5-hex-nut` into the following region
	![](img/y-gantry-hex-nut.png)

## Create Front-Left-Leg Subassembly

### Prepare front-left-leg
- Remove any stringing from the print with a heat gun
- Insert 3x `m5-hex-nut` into the following regions
	- 2x in bottom of the leg for customer-side `front-leg-extension` mounting 
	![](img/front-leg-extension-mounting-nut1.png)
	![](img/front-leg-extension-mounting-nut2.png)
	- 1x near extrusion pocket for customer-side attachment of front-drag-chain-mount
 	![](img/front-drag-chain-mount-nut.png)
 	
- Insert 1x `m5-nylock-hex-nut` into in the underside of `belt-tensioner-arm` mounting post
	![](img/belt-tension-arm-nut.png)

### Prepare belt-tensioner-arm
- Press an `M3-hex-nut` into the `belt-tension-arm` with a `arbor-press-jig`
![](img/tensioner-arm-m3-hex-nut-insertion.png)
- Thread a `M3x16-bolt` through the `belt-tension-arm`
![](img/m3x16-tensioner-bolt-install.png)
- Thread a `M3-acorn-nut` onto the end of the bolt
	-  The `M3-acorn-nut` and `M3-hex-nut` should be on the same side of the `belt-tensioner-arm`
	-  Tighten the `M3-acorn-nut` onto the `M3x16-bolt` with a 5.5mm socket and an allen wrench
	
	![](img/M3-acorn-nut-install.png)
	![](img/tighten-acorn-nut1.png)
	![](img/tighten-acorn-nut2.png)


- Rotate the `M3x16-bolt` until the `M3-acorn-nut` is loosely resting against the `M3-hex-nut`

	!!!info "This ensures the `belt-tensioner-arm` is installed with it's adjustment range fully available for when it's time to tension `GT2-belt`"

	![](img/tensioner-bolt-ok-ng.png)

- Insert a `M5-nylock-hex-nut` into `belt-tension-arm`'s hex-nut pocket
	![](img/gt2-pivot-hex-nut-insert.png)

- Slide a `GT2-idler-pulley` into the `belt-tensioner-arm` 
	![](img/gt2-idler-install.png)

	!!!note "Note that the `GT2-idler-pulley` is symmetrical, so it's orientation does not matter"
	
- Install a `M5x25-bolt` into the `belt-tensioner-arm` to secure the `GT2-idler-pulley` in place
	- Avoid over tightening this bolt as the `GT2-idler-pulley` should be able to spin freely without resistance
	- The bolt should, however, be tightened enough to eliminate lateral pulley movement within the `belt-tensioner-arm`

	![](img/gt2-idler-pivot-bolt.png)
	
### Install belt-tensioner-arm onto front-left-leg

- Add a drop of `ptfe-silicone-lubricant` to both sides of `belt-tensioner-arm`'s pivot point 

- Install `belt-tensioner-arm` onto `front-left-leg`
	![](img/belt-tensioner-arm-asm-install.png)

- Secure the `belt-tensioner-arm` onto `front-left-leg` with a `M5x40-bolt`
	- Avoid over tightening this bolt as the `belt-tensioner-arm` should be able to pivot freely without *much *resistance
	
	![](img/belt-tensioner-pivot-bolt.png)

- The completed `front-left-leg` should match the image shown below
	![](img/complete-front-left-leg.png)

## Create Back-Left-Leg Subassembly

### Prepare back-leg
- Remove any stringing from the 3D print with a heat gun
- Insert an `m5-hex-nut` into the bottom of the `back-leg` 3D print
	- Finger strength *should* be sufficient to install this fastener into position
	!!!glue "Glue if needed"
		Add a drop of loctite to the region if the fastener fit is looser than normal and seems at risk of falling out in transit
	![](img/back-leg-hex-nut1.png)
	![](img/back-leg-hex-nut2.png)
	
### Prepare y-gantry stepper motor
- Gather the following parts and tools
	- nema17-stepper-motor
	- GT2-timing-pulley
	- y-timing-pulley-spacer-jig
	- Torque driver w/2mm hex driver, set to `0.7 N/M` *(not shown)*

	![](img/y-gantry-motor-prep0.png)
- Use motor spacing jig to mount the timing pulley to the NEMA 17, ensuring the set screw is aligned to the flat side of the motor shaft 
	![](img/y-gantry-motor-prep1.png)
- Tighten the 2x timing pulley set screws to 0.7 N/M - first tightening the one facing the flat on the motor shaft 
	![](img/y-gantry-motor-prep2.png)
	![](img/y-gantry-motor-prep3.png)
	
### Install y-gantry stepper motor onto back-leg
- Connect `Y1-stepper-motor-cable` to the `y-gantry-stepper-motor`

	![](img/y1-cable-connected.png)

- Install the  `y-gantry-stepper-motor` onto `back-leg`
	- The `Y1-stepper-motor-cable` should be routed through `back-leg` to exit towards the center of the machine
	- Ensure no wires are being crushed or strained 

	![](img/install-y1-stepper.png)

- Put 4x `M3x8-bolt` through the motor mounting holes found on `back-leg`

	![](img/bolt-y1-stepper-motor.png)
	 	
- Install a `zip-tie` for cable strain relief 
	- Use a `zip-tie` to attached the `Y1-stepper-motor-cable` to the `back-leg` to add strain relief
	
		![](img/zip-tie-y1-cable1.png)
	
	- Cut the `zip-tie` with `flush-cutters`
	
		![](img/zip-tie-y1-cable2.png)
		
	- Ensure that `Y1-stepper-motor-cable` and `zip-tie` are resting against the logo-face side of `back-leg`
		
		![](img/zip-tie-y1-cable3.png)

## Assemble y-gantry-left

### Install front-left-leg and back-leg onto 600mm-alu-extrusion 

- Begin by inserting a `525mm-m3-t-nut-bar` into a piece of `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	- There should be about 51.5mm between the end of the `525mm-m3-t-nut-bar` and the right-side end of the `600mm-alu-extrusion` after installation
	- The `525mm-m3-t-nut-bar` needs to be slide aside in later steps, so do not bother to make this perfect right now
	
	![](img/install-tnut-bar.png)
	
- Insert `front-left-leg` and `back-leg` onto 2x pieces of `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	- The `525mm-m3-t-nut-bar` is oriented in the top-side groove of the uppermost `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	- The extrusion pieces should be *fully* inserted into each leg

	![](img/install-legs-onto-ext.png)
	
- Bolt `back-leg` to `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	- Insert 3x `m3-t-nut` into the `600mm-alu-extrusion` pieces before sliding each of them into alignment with the matching bolt holes on `back-leg`

		![](img/back-leg-t-nut-insertion.png)

	- Insert 3x `M5x10-bolt` into `back-leg` and thread the bolts into each corresponding `M3-t-nut` 

		![](img/bolt-back-leg-to-ext.png)

- Bolt `front-left-leg` to `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	- Slide the `M3-t-nut-bar` out of the way *if needed*
	- Insert an `M3-t-nut` into the upper channel of `600mm-alu-extrusion` 
	- Align the `M3-t-nut` with the top-side bolt hole on `front-left-leg`  
		
		![](img/insert-front-leg-top-t-nut.png)
		
	- Insert a `M5x10-bolt` into the top-side bolt hole on `front-left-leg` and tighten it into the `M3-t-nut`
		
		![](img/insert-front-leg-top-m5x10-bolt.png)

	- Slide 2x `M3-t-nut` into the the side channel of lower `600mm-alu-extrusion` and align them with the two bolt holes on `front-left-leg`
		
		![](img/insert-front-leg-bottom-t-nut.png)

	- Insert 2x `M5x10-bolt` into the side bolt holes on `front-left-leg` and tighten each into the corresponding `M3-t-nut`
		
		![](img/insert-front-leg-side-t-nut.png)
		
- Compare the WIP `y-gantry-left` assembly to the image below after completing all previous steps, address any discrepancies as needed before proceeding onward

	![](img/y-gantry-left-process-check1.png)

### Install linear-rail-550mm

- Roughtly position `linear-rail-550mm` onto top-side of uppermost `600mm-alu-extrusion`
	
	![](img/position-y-linear-rail.png)

- Place a `linear-rail-2020-alignment-jig` on both ends of `linear-rail-550mm`
	- Do not cover any bolt holes with the jig  

	![](img/insert-y-rail-alignment-jig.png)

- Visually center the `linear-rail-550mm` between the `back-leg` and `front-left-leg`
- Slide the `M3-t-nut-bar` to line up with the linear rail's bolt hole pattern 
- Starting from the `front-left-leg` side, lightly snug a `M3x8-bolt` into **every other** bolt hole on `linear-rail-550mm`
	- Move the `linear-rail-carriage` out of the way as needed

	![](img/install-11x-linear-rail-bolts.png)
	
- Torque the rail mounting bolts to specification in sequence beginning with the bolts at the center of the rail and working towards each end. 
	- A torque wrench should be used to set the specified bolt torque
	- The torque specification for these `M3x8-bolts` is `0.5N/M`

	![](img/y-linear-rail-bolt-sequence.png)

- Remove the `linear-rail-2020-alignment-jig` from both ends of `linear-rail-550mm`
- Slide the linear-rail-carriage back and forth a few times, checking to see that it travels smoothly and consistently

### Halfway Checkpoint

- Verify that `y-gantry-left` matches the following photo

	![](img/y-gantry-checkpoint.png)
	
!!!success "If `y-gantry-left` matches the photo, proceed to the next section"
!!!failure "If `y-gantry-left` does not match the photo, correct discrepancies before proceeding to the next section"

### Install GT2-belt
- Route a 1.3m-long piece of `GT2-belt` through `y-gantry-left`
	
	!!!info "Belt routing step-by-step"
			- Start by running the belt through the `y-gantry`'s left-side slot and leave 75mm of extra belt poking out 
			- Run it through the extrusion towards the `back-leg`
			- Wrap it around the `timing-pulley`
			- Run it back through the extrusion towards the `front-left-leg`
			- Wrap it around the `idler-pulley`
			- Run it back through the extrusion towards the `back-leg` again
			- Have the belt exit through the `y-gantry`'s right-side slot

	![](img/route-belt-through-step1.png)

- Slide the `y-gantry` subassembly onto the `linear-rail-carriage` while pulling slack out of the `GT2-belt`
	![](img/route-belt-through-step2.png)
	![](img/belt-pulled-through-irl.png)
	
- Bolt `y-gantry` to the `linear-rail-carriage with` 4x `M3x8-bolt`
	- Tighten each bolt to 0.5 N/M
	- Push `y-gantry` inward towards the `linear-rail-carriage while tightening the mounting bolts to align it  

	![](img/bolt-y-gantry-to-carriage.png)

- Use `belt-clamp` with 2x `M5x10-bolt` to clamp the left-side of the `GT2-belt` to the `y-gantry`
	- Tighten each `M5x10-bolt` to 0.5 N.M

	![](img/route-belt-through-step3.png)
	![](img/route-belt-through-step4.png)

### Tension the Y-Gantry

- Pull the right-side `GT2-belt` tightly towards `front-left-leg`

	![](img/route-belt-through-step5.png)

- Use `belt-clamp` with 2x `M5x10-bolt` to clamp the right-side `GT2-belt` to the `y-gantry`
	- Tighten each `M5x10-bolt` to 0.5 N.M 

	![](img/route-belt-through-step6.png)

- Rotate the `M3x16-bolt` clockwise on the `belt-tensioner-arm` to tension the `GT2-belt` installed on `y-gantry-left`
	- This will cause the `belt-tensioner-arm` to pull the `idler-pulley` away from the `front-left-leg` which adds desired tension to the `GT2-belt`

	![](img/tension-belt-arm.png)

- Trim the loose `GT2-belt` on either side of the `y-gantry`
	- For the `front-left-leg` side of the `y-gantry` print, trim the loose `GT2-belt` until it's flush against the belt-clamp 
	- For the `back-leg` side of the `y-gantry` print, trim the loose `GT2-belt` until it's flush against the belt-clamp 

	![](img/belt-cut-to-length.png)

### Add cable management 

- Use 3x `extrusion-cable-clip` to secure the `Y1-stepper-motor-cable` to the inner side of the lower `600mm-alu-extrusion`

	![](img/y-gantry-extrusion-cable-clip.png)
