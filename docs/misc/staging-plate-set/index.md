!!! Warning
	This set of work instructions is unfinished!

## Purpose
The purpose of this work instructions is to document the assembly process for various ways staging-plate [`PCB-0003-00`] is converted into customer salable parts kits.

<details>
<summary> Explanation of various staging-plate shipping configurations</summary>

When we receive orders for staging plates, customers can select whether they want a 1-pack or a 2-pack at checkout. Depending on whether they buy their staging plates with additional items or not has an impact on how we package these goods.<br>
<br>
If a customer orders either 1 or 2 staging plate(s) and nothing else, we will ship them one of the following products:<br>
- Packaged Staging Plate (1-Pack)<br>
- Packaged Staging Plate (2-Pack)
<br>
<br>
Note: When a customer orders 2x Staging Plate (1-Pack), we treat this as a single order for a Packaged Staging Plate (2-Pack). This is done to prevent wasted packaging material and lower shipping costs.
<br>
<br>
When customer orders a permutation of products, such as one of the examples below, we will ship a quantity of the following products that's required to fulfill their order:

<br>- Unpackaged Staging Plate (1-Pack)
<br>- Unpackaged Staging Plate (2-Pack)

<details>
<summary> Example permutations that can trigger this switch:</summary>

	- purchase more than 2 staging plates<br>
	- purchase one of our smaller items, like a getting-started-kit, alongside some amount of staging plates<br>
	- purchases extra staging plates with their LumenPnP v3 order<br>

</details>

The reason for all this nuance is that order permutations can mean we may have to use something other than the designated staging plate box.
<br>
 - Sometimes a box is not even required, like when a customer gets extra plates with their v3.
<br>
 - Some combinations of items will even fit in a staging plate box, yet we won't be able to follow the usual packaging instructions!
<br>
 - In the future it will be better to get rid of the Packaged Staging Plate SKUs and eliminate this complexity all together.<br>

## Instructions

### Creating Staging Plate (Unpackaged 2-Pack) units
Relevant Opulo MFG P/N:

- Staging Plate (Unpacked 2-Pack) [`ASM-0050-02`]


####Prepare 2x staging-plate units
* Collect 2x staging-plate from inventory
* Clean both sides of each staging-plate with an IPA-soaked shop rag to remove dust and scuffs
* Inspect for defects/damage on the top and bottom surfaces of the PCB
	* Reference the [Opulo Cosmetic Quality Standards documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vblE59KeiyKYdd655MeTJDzQi4rJhu8tgH3RU7gAahY/edit?usp=sharing)
	* Bring anything thatâ€™s debatable to a manager for a judgment call

#### Prepare 2x Staging Plate Attachment Hardware set [`ASM-0028-2`]
* Create the 2x Staging Plate Attachment Hardware set [`ASM-0028-02`] units
* Each set is made by placing the following components into a 2 1/2" x 3" Reclosable Bag:
	* 4x M5x8mm-button-head
	* 4x M5-tslot-nut

#### Plastic wrap the staging plates and hardware bags
* Wrap the first staging-plate in three wraps of cling-wrap
* After the third wrap, fold the excess cling-wrap inward
* Place the second staging-plate atop the previously wrapped staging-plate
* Wrap the second staging-plate in two wraps of cling-wrap
* Fold the excess cling-wrap inward again
* Place 2x Staging Plate Attachment Hardware sets atop the second staging-plate
* Give the bundle of components a final wrap to secure everything
* Cut the wrapped component bundle away from the cling-wrap spool 
* Fold the excess cling wrap onto the bundle for a final time
* Pat the cling-wrap down to smooth out any creases and firm up the bond

#### Prepare aux-staging-plate-foot

### Creating Staging Plate (Unpackaged 1-Pack) units
Relevant Opulo MFG P/N:

- Staging Plate (Unpackaged 1-Pack) [`ASM-0049-03`]

!!! Info "This assembly process basically identical to the Staging Plate (Unpacked 2-Pack) [`ASM-0050-02`], however `ASM-0049-03` only includes 1 staging-plate, bolt bag, and foot. Less cling-wrap can be used when packaging `ASM-0049-03` as well."

### Creating Staging Plate (2-Pack) and (1-Pack) units
#### Prepare Packaging

* Fold staging plate box
* Cut foam sheets into 6"x4" sections
* Place 2x 6"x4" pieces of foam on both sides of the open box
	* Aim to use pieces of foam that are similar sizes, they are never cut to perfectly matching sizes so this is good practice

#### Finishing Packaged Staging Plate (2-Pack) units
* Place a Staging Plate (Unpacked 2-Pack) [`ASM-0050-02`] into the box 
	* Sandwich the assembly between two pieces of foam on either side of the box
* Place 2x aux-staging-plate-foot units into the box
	* Make sure they have the M3x14-bolt installed 
* Add strips of scrap foam to the front and back of the box to protect the staging plate's sides while in transit
* Close the box and tape it shut with 3" packaging tape
* Label the box as a Packaged Staging Plate (2-Pack)

#### Finishing Packaged Staging Plate (1-Pack) units
* Place a Staging Plate (Unpacked 1-Pack) [`ASM-0049-03`] into the box 
	* Sandwich the assembly between two pieces of foam on either side of the box
* Place 1x aux-staging-plate-foot units into the box
	* Make sure it has the M3x14-bolt installed 
* Add strips of scrap foam to the front and back of the box to protect the staging plate's sides while in transit
* Close the box and tape it shut with 3" packaging tape
* Label the box as a Packaged Staging Plate (1-Pack)
