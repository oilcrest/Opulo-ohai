### Prepare additional components

6. Proceed by preparing the following components:
	-  Packaged Ring Light Set [`ASM-0026-00`] - Place a top-ring-light and bottom-ring-light into a 2 1/2" x 3" Reclosable Bag
	-  limit-switch-board [`PCA-0002-00`] - Without opening the vendor provided bag, actuate the switch to ensure that it clicks properly
		
		!!! warning "If a limit-switch-board does not seem correct when actuated, either audibly or tactually, bring it to MRB"
			
	-  Packaged Datum Board [`ASM-0024-00`] - Place a datum-board and Opulo Logo Sticker into a 2 1/2" x 3" Reclosable Bag
		
		!!! info "Clean the datum-board with an IPA-soaked shop rag if it appears dirty"

### Package additional components
	
7. Place a sheet of pink foam into the esd-safe-mailer
	- Leave half of the foam sitting against the motherboard
	- The other half of the foam sheet will be folded atop the additional components packaged into the box in subsequent steps
8. Place the Packaged Datum Board [`ASM-0024-00`] into the box

11. Fold the rest of the pink foam over the Packaged Ring Light Set
	- This will result in something like a taco of additional components sitting beside the motherboard

### Finalize
	
12. Close the esd-safe-mailer
13. Write the following information on the box's front face with a silver permanent marker:
	- The last 3 digits of the motherboard serial number
	- The given LumenPnP PCB Kit (Salable) [`SKU-0003-02`] production build number
	!!! warning "If the build number is not known, please ask for assistance"
