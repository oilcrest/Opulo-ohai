	!!! note
		TheÂ polarity does not matter when attaching these two wires to the motor leads
	
5. Use lead-free solder to attach `CHA-0011-00` to the leads of the vacuum-pump

	!!! info "QC Inspection"
		Inspect the solder joints for proper bond, being sure to rework any loose wire strands or cold joints before continuing
	
7. Slide heat shrink over solder joints and motor leads

9. Use a permanent marker to black out the `P1` text on the `CHA-0011-00` label

10. Perform cable management 
	- Wrap `CHA-0011-00` around the top-side of vacuum-pump, as shown below, before securing the cable in place with a rubber-band

### Create Packaged Rubber Band Set
1. Place 2x rubber-band into a 1 1/2" x 1 1/2" Reclosable Bag
2. Seal the bag when completed and set aside for later use

### Prepare Packaging Labels
  
1. Print LumenPnP Vacuum Pump and Valve Set bag labels by accessing our account on [Avery Print](https://www.avery.com/myaccount/projects)
	- See [SOP-0007](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jm7L9rtee2UymbxKDrj7xCHDT8VNdBmkq5X-eJMKwhk/edit) for access credentials
2. Print 2x labels out at time by printing them on the DYMO 4XL label maker with 4" x 6" label paper loaded
3. Cut the printed 4" x 6" labels in half to create 2x 4" x 3" LumenPnP Vacuum Pump and Valve Set [`SKU-0004-00`] labels

	!!! info "Check Inventory"
		There's usually a pre-made surplus of these labels so check inventory before assuming you need to print more copies

### Package Components
	
1. Package the following components into a 6" x 9" Polybag
	* Packaged Rubber Band Set
	* Wired Vacuum Pump Assembly
	* solenoid-valve
		* Twist the solenoid-valve units pre-attached cable around the valve body a few times before placing it into the bag

3. Adhere a 4" x 3" LumenPnP Pump and Valve Set label to the 6" x 9" Polybag as shown in the image below

	<img src="img/image16.jpg" width="60%"/>

	<img src="img/image17.jpg" width="60%"/>
	
4. Roll up the packaged components to eliminate wasted space in the bag
5. Seal the roll together by using the exposed backside of the LumenPnP Vacuum Pump and Valve Set bag label as a tape
