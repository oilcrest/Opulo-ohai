## Instructions

### Prepare Toolhead Assembly
1. Install a CP40-holder and pneumatic-coupler onto a NEMA11-hollow-shaft-stepper
	*  Use a torque driver w/10mm socket and adjustable wrench to tighten these items onto the motor shaft
		*  Set the torque driver to `0.5 N/M` for this step
	*  Use the adjustable wrench to hold the CP40-holder stationary while applying torque from the pneumatic-coupler side
	*  The pneumatic-coupler should be installed closer to the motor's cable connector

	### Prepare Toolhead Cable
 
4. Use a permanent marker to black out the `LM` text on the label of `CHA-0005-01`

	!!! Note
		The toolhead cable included this product is an older rev of l-motor-harness than what's used in the [LumenPnP v3 Drag Chain](../lumen/drag-chain)
		
		*  Since we do not know if customers are using this cable for the left head or right head, it is better that ship them a cable with no labels
		*  We use `CHA-0005-01` there is only 1 label we need to deface/remove - which is the LM label found on the cable's motherboard side

	### Prepare Packaging
	
5. Print LumenPnP Toolhead Assembly bag labels by accessing our account on [Avery Print](https://www.avery.com/myaccount/projects)
	- See [SOP-0007](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jm7L9rtee2UymbxKDrj7xCHDT8VNdBmkq5X-eJMKwhk/edit) for access credentials
	- Print 2x labels out at time by printing them on the DYMO 4XL label maker with 4" x 6" label paper loaded
	- Cut the printed 4" x 6" labels in half to create 2x 4" x 3" LumenPnP Toolhead Assembly [`SKU-0005-02`] labels

	### Package Components
	
7. Package the following components into the labeled 6" x 9" Polybag
	* NEMA11-hollow-shaft-stepper (w/attached CP40-holder, pneumatic-coupler, and bolts)
	* l-motor-harness
	* silicone-grease-packet
