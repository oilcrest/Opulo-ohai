## Purpose

The purpose of this work instructions is to document the assembly process for the LumenPnP Toolhead Assembly [`SKU-0005-03`]

## Instructions

### Prepare Toolhead Assembly
1. Install a `nozzle-holder` and `rotary-pneumatic-adapter` onto `NEMA11-hollow-shaft-stepper`
	*  Use a torque driver w/custom `rotary-pneumatic-adapter-socket` and 8mm wrench to tighten these components onto the motor shaft
		*  Set the torque driver to `0.5 N/M` for this step
	*  Use the 8mm wrench to hold the `nozzle-holder` stationary while applying torque from the `rotary-pneumatic-adapter`side
	*  The `rotary-pneumatic-adapter` should be installed closer to the motor's cable connector

### Prepare Packaging

5. Print LumenPnP Toolhead Assembly bag labels by accessing our account on [Avery Print](https://www.avery.com/myaccount/projects)
	- See [SOP-0007](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jm7L9rtee2UymbxKDrj7xCHDT8VNdBmkq5X-eJMKwhk/edit) for access credentials
	- Print 2x labels out at time by printing them on the DYMO 4XL label maker with 4" x 6" label paper loaded
	- Cut the printed 4" x 6" labels in half to create 2x 4" x 3" LumenPnP Toolhead Assembly labels <br>
