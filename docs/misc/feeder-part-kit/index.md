* `peel-motor` [`MTR-00003-00`]
	* Shaft cannot be free-spin by hand
	* Wire soldered to motor leads correctly 
	* Connector end of wire is intact with no loose crimps

* Cut the webbing out from in-between 2 pockets to create a larger pocket for the `drive-wheel-asm`
	* It is OK to put 2x `drive-wheel-asm` pieces in each pocket provided the `shaft-collar` pieces face away from each other

* 	Continue by packaging the tray with however many `feeder-part-kit` sets were ordered

* Cut the filled tray section out from the rest of the tray
	* Just 1 order of `feeder-part-kit` is shown here, but this cutaway section can be bigger if additional sets were ordered by the same person.
	* Cut the filled trays into a size that works well with the package you intend to use - you may not even need to cut the tray if enough `feeder-part-kit` sets were ordered!

* For orders of 5+ `feeder-part-kit` sets, it's OK to simply stack filled trays atop one another
	* Just aim for a professional looking packout with trays sized appropriately for the box you use
