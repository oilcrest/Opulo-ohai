## Packaging

### Packaging <5 sets

* Collect a scrap foam tray used in `drive-motor` shipments

* Cut the webbing out from in-between 2 pockets to create a larger pocket for the `drive-wheel-asm`
	* It is OK to put 1x-3x `drive-wheel-asm` pieces in each pocket provided the `shaft-collar`

* 	Continue by packaging the tray with however many `feeder-part-kit` sets were ordered

	<img style="height:500px;" src="img/feeder-part-kit-3.png">
	
* Cut the filled tray section out from the rest of the tray
	* Just 1 order of `feeder-part-kit` is shown here, but this cutaway section can be bigger if additional sets were ordered by the same person.
	* Cut the filled trays into a size that works well with the package you intend to use - you may not even need to cut the tray if enough `feeder-part-kit` sets were ordered!

### Packaging 5+ Sets

* For orders of 5+ `feeder-part-kit` sets, it's OK to simply stack filled trays atop one another
	* Just aim for a professional looking pack-out with trays sized appropriately for the box you use 

### Packaging 50 Sets
When packaging 50 sets of `feeder-part-kit` use the following section for guidance. The images below show how to best package a 50pcs `feeder-part-kit` order.

* Cut up a `drive-motor`'s foam tray to fit in a `OPF-folder-box`
	* There should be 17 double-wide pockets to hold `drive-wheel-asm`
	* There should be 50 regular size pockets to hold 50x `drive-motor`
	  
	<img style="height:500px;" src="img/feeder-part-kit-17.png">
	
* Fill the `drive-motor`'s foam tray with components
	* Place a `drive-motor` into each of the 50x regular-size pockets, doing your best to tuck the cable in so it's not loose outside the pocket
	* Place 3x `drive-wheel-asm` in each of the 17x double-wide pockets, giving the customer 50pcs + 1pcs (spare) in total

* Fill the `peel-motor` foam tray with motors

	<img style="height:500px;" src="img/feeder-part-kit-13.png">

* Place the packaged `peel-motor` foam tray on top of the packaged `drive-motor` foam tray
