We get a pre-made bag of *most* of the hardware pre-made.

It needs **six** things added, and **one** thing changed.

## Swap

Hunt down the bag of 4x M3 "square nuts".

They're weird, and won't work for a LumenPnP build. Toss them, but keep the bag, and replace with 4x normal M3 square nuts. Add back to the main bag.
