            If you want to create a document that has a unique size, such as an envelope or card, first see if the paper size appears in the Paper Size pop-up menu.
            
            If not, you can create your own custom paper size. Custom paper sizes aren’t available for some printers or for all apps.

            Note: The following options might not be available for your printer or app. If these instructions differ from what you see onscreen, refer to the documentation that came with the app you’re using.

            1. Choose File > Print. If you see a Show Details button, click it to show all available options.

            2. Click the Paper Size pop-up menu, then choose Manage Custom Sizes.

            3. Click the Add button  to add a new paper size, then specify the paper size you want.

            To create a new paper size based on an existing size, select a paper size in the list, then click Duplicate.

            To print to a custom paper size, choose it from the Paper Size pop-up menu in the Print dialog (choose File > Print). To set a document size to a custom paper size, choose it from the Paper Size pop-up menu in the Page Setup dialog (choose File > Page Setup).

            !!!info "If a document is printing with incorrect margins or clipped text, try this:"
                Click the Non-Printable Area pop-up menu, choose User Defined, then enter zero for the nonprintable margins. In some cases this allows the document margins to print as expected.

* Asset ID:
    * A unique alphanumeric identifier generated by Aligni to track individual units (e.g., separate reels, trays, or packages).

    !!!info "The steps below assume a line item from the PO was delivered in multiple packages. If this is not the case, you simply type the line item's `Order Quantity` in the `QTY` text-field – and skip the next two steps."

      * !!!note "Note: In this example, we entered a value of `1` three times because we recieved 3 units of `3000-piece-pack`."

            This will result in eventually creating a unique asset tag for each of the three 3000pcs bolt boxes.

      *  !!!warning "Verify: if the line item has arrived in full, the total of all text fields must equal the order quantity."
      *   Click `Split` when ready

7. Click the `Datecode` field and enter the date the item was received in `yyyy-mm-dd` format

## Additional Notes

* Partial Shipments:
    * You can receive items against the same PO multiple times until the line item is fully received.
    * Once the recieved amount matches the order quantity, the line item closes and cannot be received again.
    * This is different than splitting – making use of this is helpful when a line item is fulfilled across a span of time.

* Corrections:

      * If you mistakenly receive inventory:

          1. Correct the item’s stock level in the Inventory tab.

          2. Update the PO line item’s “Received” column to reflect the correct received-to-date amount.

        !!!warning "Inventory logs cannot be edited or deleted — they act as an audit trail."

* Units of Measure:
    * Aligni always stores inventory in the item’s native unit of measure.
    * If the PO uses a different UoM, Aligni auto-converts and preserves the purchased UoM as a display field.

* Currency:
    * All inventory is valued in the site’s base currency.
    * Purchases in other currencies are converted at Aligni’s daily exchange rate (sourced from Google) unless you manually set another rate.
